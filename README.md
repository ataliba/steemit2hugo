Steemit to Hugo

This is the first version of this script. 
I will change many things 

This script is based on this [post on Steemit](https://steemit.com/steemdev/@holger80/store-all-posts-from-an-author-in-markdown-files) .

To use this script we need to run using **Python** 

<code>python save_posts_as_md.py <author> <path></code>


#TODO:
